This example uses OpenGL and SDL2 to render a simple particle system.


If you're using Debian or Ubuntu you can get the SDL2 dependency by
running:

$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

If you're on a mac, install homebrew and then:

$ brew install sdl2

If you're on Windows then download a prebuilt version of SDL2 and set
up a visual studio project that builds main.c and links the SDL2
library. http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
