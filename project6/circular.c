/*
 * First define what the real _cbuf struct should look like. Remember,
 * this is opaque to the users of your library so you can do whatever
 * you like in here. The _cbuf struct is typedefd in the header to the
 * cbuf type so you're free to use either type mostly
 * interchangably. The one exception is that sizeof calls must use the
 * _cbuf type.

/*
 * Now define your implementations of all of the functions given in
 * the header. The test programs will not link successfully until each
