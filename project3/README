Project 3: Converting to Hexadecimal

Find the full project description here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1htIaTfGE19iO5VIRytxiGakFaZI3PjmxZv0B2sXzhG8/edit?usp=sharing

Feel free to edit proj3.asm in place to create your program.

Test your code by typing:

$ make test

The output of make test will simply be "Program output matches
expected" when your program passes all of the public tests.

If your program fails the public tests then make test shows the lines
that were expected (prefixed by <) and the lines that were seen
(prefixed by >) along with the test "Program output does not match
expected"

The only thing you need to submit for project 3 is your proj3.asm
file. Notice that no typescript file is required. You can submit it
using:

submit cmsc313_btaylor proj3.asm
