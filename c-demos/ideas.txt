Some ideas that you could add to calc.c in your experimentations:

Easy
* A modulus operator "%"
* Negation
* Integer logarithm

Medium
* Support for reading negative numbers
* Duplicate top value on the stack
* Drop the top value on the stack
* Swap the top two values on the stack

Hard
* Fully convert to a floating point stack
* Add support for sin/cos/tan/tan2

Expert
* Support both integer and floating point values on the stack simultaneously
* Support strings on the stack
* Convert numbers on the stack to/from strings on the stack
* String manipulation (concatenation, substring, etc)
